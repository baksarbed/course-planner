 *
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Automated course planner that given all courses, automatically finds
 * a non-conflicting match. It also alows for manual selection of
 * courses by specifying particular sections, and reports any conflicts.
 *
 *
 *
 * @section INSTRUCTIONS
 *
 * As input, provide a file which includs a listing of all courses in 
 * one semester. See the sample input file, fall2009.txt. If such a file
 * not accessible, inside the Data directoroy, there is Lex/Yacc parser
 * that can create a suitable input file from a .cvs file (also a sample 
 * .cvs can be found). To do so, run the following (in Linux):
 * 
 *	...\course-planner\Data$ make
 *      ...\course-planner\Data$ ./parser < example.cvs   > output.txt
 *
 * 
 * Note: for the .cvs file, each LEC (lecture) should have three 1 hour
 *       classes. In cases with less than 3 hours of lecture, still there
 *       should be three different rows for that lecture, but with start
 *       and end times equal to 00:00:00.
 *
 * Copy the output.txt (which will be the input to planner) to the directory
 * of course-planner, then run the program on it as follows:
 * 
 *	..\course-planner$ make clean
 *      ..\course-planner$ make
 *      ..\course-planner$ ./planner output.txt
 *
 * From this point on, a menu will guide you through actions that can be
 * taken. Options are well explained as much as possible, and after while
 * should become easy to use. Should you have any concerns, questions, or
 * suggestions, or to report bugs, please contact the author.
